### Now it's time to wrap this up with renaming the files as we wanted
### Here x is the iterating variable and if you want to have a custom name added to every image then you can surely made adjustment to the code

## without custom name
$((x = 0)); for j in *.jpg; do mv -- "$j" "$((++x)).jpg"; done

## with custom name
$((x = 0)); for j in *.jpg; do mv -- "$j" "{ADD_CUSTOM_NAME_BEFORE}$((++x)){ADD_CUSTOM_NAME_AFTER}.jpg"; done
